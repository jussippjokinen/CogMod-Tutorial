Before starting the tutorial it is worth knowing a little about the Python programming language and also about Jupyter Notebooks. If you are unfamiliar with notebooks and Python, you may want to start with the getting_started.ipynb notebook in the 01-Introduction/. Otherwise, you can start with the Fitts' Law notebook and proceed from there.
