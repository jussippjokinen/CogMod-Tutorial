# CogMod-Tutorial

CogMod-Tutorial is a set of Python Jupyter Notebooks designed as an introduction to cognitive, neural and RL modeling in Human-Computer Interaction. 

Designed for delivery at CHI2022 AND CHI2023 by Jussi Jokinen, Antti Oulasvirta and Andrew Howes.

Before starting the tutorial it is worth knowing a little about the Python programming language and also about Jupyter Notebooks. 

The notebooks for the tutorial are made available in this GitHub repository and they are designed to be executed using Google Colaboratory (Colab). 

Note that the full version of the tutorial will only be available on the day that it is delivered at CHI'2023.
