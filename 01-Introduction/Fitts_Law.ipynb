    "# Fitts' Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitts' law provides a quantitative relationship between movement time in human pointing and the design of the pointing task. This model is instrumental in HCI for evaluating and designing user interfaces by optimizing the time and effort needed for common tasks. In this notebook, we will explore the mathematical underpinnings of Fitts' Law, demonstrating its application in analyzing and enhancing UI efficiency. The learning outcomes of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding of how mathematical formulas can describe psychological phenomena; and\n",

    "## Origins of Fitts' Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitts' Law was formulated in 1954 by psychologist Paul Fitts, originating from his empirical research on human motor skills. His work, deeply rooted in the principles of information theory and cybernetics, sought to understand the control aspects of human movement, particularly in the context of aiming or pointing tasks. Fitts' experiments led to the realization that a logarithmic relationship exists between the speed and accuracy of movements, encapsulated as an equation (the *Fitts' Law*). This discovery was pivotal in linking human cognitive processes with quantifiable metrics, laying a foundation for subsequent research in ergonomics, human factors, and HCI. Fitts' Law stands as a landmark in the history of cognitive psychology and its application to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original experiment conducted by Paul Fitts involved a simple setup to study the relationship between movement speed and target accuracy. Participants were asked to perform a series of rapid, repetitive pointing tasks using a hand-held stylus. The task required them to move the stylus back and forth between two flat, rectangular targets as quickly and accurately as possible. These targets varied in width (W) and distance (D) from each other. By manipulating these two parameters, Fitts observed how the speed of movement was influenced by the difficulty of the task, which he quantified as the ratio of the distance to the width of the target. This setup provided empirical data that led to the formulation of Fitts' Law, highlighting the logarithmic relationship between the time taken to complete the movement and the difficulty of the task.\n",

    "# Information Processing in Fitts' Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitts' law views motor manipulations as transmission of information between the human decision maker and the interactive system. A human user, equipped with a device such as a mouse, keyboard, joystick, eye movement sensor, or even a some sort of a neural link, transmits information to the system according to an index of performance (IP). The units of IP is bits/s, meaning that the higher the IP, the more information is being transmitted in a second. The task itself has an index of difficuly (ID), which determines how many bits need to be transmitted before the task is completed. Therefore, given movement time (MT), we define $IP = ID/MT$. As index of performance, given a user and a device, stays approximately constant, we can infer that as the task becomes more difficult (IP increases), movement time must equally increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can treat all \"motor\" actions by the user as transmission of information. For instance, perhaps a successful command will require 128 bits of information (this can encode, e.g., a short sentence). The IP computed for the human hand in the original Fitts' experiment is about 10 bits/s. We can solve how long it takes to transmit one sentence with the hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ IP = ID/MT $,\n",

    "\n",
    "In many time-critical tasks, this is too long. Fortunately, we can immediately cut the transmission time in half by assuming that two fingers use the keyboard to type. If we can make efficient use of ten-finger touch typing, we can achieve a theoretical transmission time of $1.28s$. This is a theoretical lower limit: generally a sentence cannot be optimally divided among 10 fingers.\n"
