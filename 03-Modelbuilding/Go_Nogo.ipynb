However, instead of using the returned noisy value as such, we assume that the human visual system exploits the fact that each noisy value is based on the true value, and the noise comes from a known distribution. We can then use a Kalman filter to approximate the true state. With more observations, the approximation becomes better. In our simulation, this is confounded by the formula above, which states that observations get better as the distance shortens. Let's investigate this behavior."

    "After having converged the model to an optimal policy, our aim is to utilize it for generating simulations of task behavior. The evaluation of the model's validity encompasses multiple stages, see the workflow.pdf draft for these. Here, we concentrate solely on its face validity, which addresses whether the model aligns with our initial predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting the model's validity assessment with face validity tests is a useful practice, as any discrepancies between the model's performance and our hypotheses at this stage may indicate issues with either the model's specification or our modeling assumptions. This is frequently an iterative procedure, during which we may observe the model's divergence from our expectations, resulting in identifying inadequate definitions of objectives, task environment, or cognitive constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model successfully demonstrates face validity, it should be subjected to a rigorous validation process, wherein its predictions are compared against human data or some alternative benchmarks. The model should e.g., generate accurate summary statistics (across a broader human population), be capable of replicating individual performance by adjusting specific parameters, and operate reasonably under changes in the environment. The specific validation depends always on the details of the modeling work."
