    "The retina is the layer of photoreceptors at the back of the eye that captures photons and transmits information to the brain. The fovea is a small depression in the middle of the retina with a particularly high density of photoreceptors. It is where visual acuity is highest. People use eye movements to bring the fovea to bear on locations about which they require more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As retinal eccentricity from the fovea increases, visual acuity falls exponentially. By just 2.5 degrees of retinal eccentricity, acuity has fallen by 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, our ability to estimate the location of an item on a display decreases exponentially with eccentricity from the fovea. The less accurate a target location estimate then the more diffcult it is to move the eyes to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model this 'bound' on cognition, it is assumed that noise in location estimates increases with eccentricity and that the noise is Gaussian distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start modeling let us first define some parameters."
